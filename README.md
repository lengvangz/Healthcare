## Situation 
This synthetic healthcare dataset has been created to serve as a valuable resource for data science, machine learning, and data analysis enthusiasts. It is designed to mimic real-world healthcare data, enabling users to practice, develop, and showcase their data manipulation and analysis skills in the context of the healthcare industry.

***

## Task
This dataset can be utilized for a wide range of purposes, including:

Developing and testing healthcare predictive models.
Practicing data cleaning, transformation, and analysis techniques.
Creating data visualizations to gain insights into healthcare trends.
Learning and teaching data science and machine learning concepts in a healthcare context.
You can treat it as a Multi-Class Classification Problem and solve it for Test Results which contains 3 categories(Normal, Abnormal, and Inconclusive).

***

## Actions 

### SQL 

** What is the average age of patients for each test result category?**

````sql
SELECT
	test_results,
	ROUND(AVG(age),2)
FROM
	healthcare.dataset
GROUP BY
	test_results;

````

#### Answer:
| test_results | avg |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Abnormal           | 51.63          |
| Inconclusive           | 51.68          |
| Normal           | 51.32          |

**Are there significant gender-based differences in test outcomes?**

````sql
SELECT
	test_results,
	gender,
	ROUND(AVG(age),2)
FROM
	healthcare.dataset
GROUP BY
	test_results,
	gender
ORDER BY
	test_results;

````

#### Answer:
| coffee_name | count | count |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Abnormal | Male           | 51.61 |

| Normal | Male           | 51.32 | 
| Normal | Female           | 51.31 | 

***

**Which age group has the highest rate of abnormal test results?**

````sql
SELECT
	test_results,
	COUNT(CASE 
	         WHEN age < 18 THEN 1
              END) AS children,
	COUNT(CASE
		WHEN age BETWEEN 19 AND 34 THEN 1
	      END) AS young_adult,
	COUNT(CASE
		WHEN age BETWEEN 35 AND 64 THEN 1
	      END) AS older_adult,
	COUNT(CASE 
		WHEN age > 65 THEN 1
	      END) AS senior

FROM
	healthcare.dataset
GROUP BY
	test_results
ORDER BY
	test_results;

````

#### Answer:
| test_results | children  | young_adult  | older_adult  | senior  |    
| ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- |  ----------- |  ----------- | 
| Abnormal           | 47  | 4240  | 8373  | 5457 |
